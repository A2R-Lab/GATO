Python bindings/wrappers.

To build, run "bindings.sh" in tools/:
```
../../../tools/bindings.sh
```

Then source the "setup_gato_env.sh" script to include the bindings in your environment:
```
source <path to setup_gato_env.sh>
```

You can now use the bindings in Python!
```
python3 sqp_pcg.py
```
